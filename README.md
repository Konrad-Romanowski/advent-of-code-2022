# Advent of Code 2022

This repository consists of my solutions to Advent of Code 2022 daily code challanges:

https://adventofcode.com/

All solutions were written on my own without checking any spoilers to the problems. Except small hints.

## Hints I used in my solutions

- _Day 7_ - I have seen hint explaining that directory was traversed in DFS approach therefore it could be solved using <code>stack</code> structure.

- _Day 10_ - [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zhmsg2/2022_day_10_sprites_and_not_the_elf_kind/) visualisation helped me to solve part II of the problem.

- _Day 20_ - Initially I tried to solve this using array, however I was also considering using some kind of <code>linked list</code> but seeing that somebody also mentioned about this was additional confirmation to use this structure.

## Additionl comments

One can notice that there are many missing solutions as I was not able to solve all of the problems. I also skipped some of the challanges as I knew that they would take me more time than one day to solve them. However I will give them a try and push late solutions when done. My approach was also to solve the problems with my current knowledge and not to learn any new algorithims / data structures during this year's challange. I will definately take part in next year's AoC and by that time I will learn some of new things.
